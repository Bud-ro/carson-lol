## About this Devlog

This is my devlog, basically a section for mini-blog posts or thoughts that
don't have enough justification for a full blog post.

You can [subscribe to this page via RSS]($link.page('devlog').alternative('rss')).

## [Testing]($section.id("2025-04-01T00:00:00"))
I've been really working hard on software testing. I earnestly want to get
better at it, since it seems like the main way of making software
that works *at all*. It seems that not many people focus on it, and certainly
don't think on it to the extent that they should. Integration testing on embedded
devices has allowed me to find literally **dozens** of bugs in the short 1 year I've used it.
I'll make a full blog post on it at some point, 
hopefully within a few weeks of the full release of [Standalone Zine](https://zine-ssg.io/).
Stay posted till then!
