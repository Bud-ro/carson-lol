I finally got around to making a blog. I'm using [Zine](https://zine-ssg.io/) for it, and so far I'm quite happy!
The Zig ecosystem is looking strong, even in its early stages! I'm sure Zine will be a reliable tool long into the future.
You'll be seeing a lot of blog posts from me in the coming months, I have been accumulating blog post ideas
for years now so there will be plenty of interesting content to look forward to.
